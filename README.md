# superNetballR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SteveLane/superNetballR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SteveLane/superNetballR)

## Description

This package allows the downloading of super netball statistics ([https://stevelane.github.io/superNetballR/](https://stevelane.github.io/superNetballR/). The first super netball season was in 2017, and was eventually won by the Sunshine Coast Lightning.

`superNetballR` contains helper functions that transform the downloaded data into usable tidy data.

## Notes

The package has been updated to account for the super goal in 2020. Ladders and points have been adjusted for this. If you want to use the old scoring systems, these are available using `_pre_2020` versions of the appropriate functions.
